# Social Media Application(Social Post)
This is the version_2 of Social Post App where i have modified the previous version. In previoue version of this app, initial posts are hardcoded and user can also create a post. In v-2 initial post were fetched from DummyAPI, a Loading spinner will be shown at initial fetching, and a message will be shown when server did responce or error occure in fetching. User can also create post form ***Create Post*** option. 

In this project i have learned that ***How to fetch data from DummyApi, how useEffect() hook will be helpfull in data fetching, displaying a Loading spinner for user intraction.***
